              At Fluorescent Landscapes, our mission is to transform outdoor spaces through bold hardscapes, 
              artistic decorative concrete, and breathtaking landscapes. We are driven by creativity, craftsmanship, 
              and a passion for designing environments that are as functional as they are unforgettable.
            </p>
            <p className="mission-statement">
              With every project, we aim to elevate the ordinary into the extraordinary—bringing color, structure, 
              and life to the spaces our clients cherish most.
